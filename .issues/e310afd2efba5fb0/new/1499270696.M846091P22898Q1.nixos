Check for a new env var 'BEFORE' which lets us supply a date (seconds
since the epoch) to limit our tests to. For example, we can run tests
which failed before yesterday, then kill the process; then run the same
command again, and it will exclude those that it's just tested (since
they didn't fail before yesterday)
